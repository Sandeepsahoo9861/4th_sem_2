//The File class does not read/write file content; instead, it provides information about the

//üü¢ This line does NOT create any actual file.
//Instead, it creates a Java object (myFile) that refers to a file name.
//
//Think of it like this: üóÇÔ∏è You just wrote "sample5.text" on a folder label. The folder is empty ‚Äî no file yet.
//....................................................
//‚úÖ Step 2: myFile.createNewFile()
//üü¢ Now you‚Äôre saying to Java:
//
//‚ÄúOkay Java, now go ahead and actually create the file you were referring to earlier.‚Äù
//
//This command will:
//
//Create the file sample5.text on your computer (in the same folder as your Java program).
//
//Return true if the file was created just now.
//
//Return false if the file already exists.//...............
//First run (when sample5.text doesn‚Äôt exist):
//
//createNewFile() returns true, so it prints:
//"Created file is sample5.text"
//
//Second run (after the file already exists):
//
//createNewFile() returns false, so it prints:
//"File already exists"
